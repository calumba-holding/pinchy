title: Create a Knowledge Base Agent
description: Step-by-step guide to creating an agent that can answer questions from your documents.
---

This guide walks you through creating a Knowledge Base agent — an agent that can read and answer questions from your documents, but cannot access anything else on the system.

## Prerequisites

- Pinchy is running (see [Quick Start](/getting-started/))
- You have mounted at least one data directory (see [Mount Data Directories](/guides/mount-data-directories/))
- You are logged in as an admin

## 1. Mount your data directories

Before creating a Knowledge Base agent, make sure the documents you want the agent to access are mounted under `/data/` in the Pinchy container. See the [Mount Data Directories](/guides/mount-data-directories/) guide for detailed instructions.

## 2. Navigate to "New Agent"

In the Pinchy sidebar, click the **+** button next to "Agents" to open the agent creation form.

## 3. Select the "Knowledge Base" template

Choose **Knowledge Base** from the template options. This template:

- Blocks the agent from using shell commands, native file access, and web requests
- Provides scoped `pinchy_ls` and `pinchy_read` tools that only work within approved directories

## 4. Enter a name

Give your agent a descriptive name, for example "HR Policy Assistant" or "Engineering Docs".

## 5. Select directories

The form displays all directories found under `/data/`. Select the directories that contain the documents this agent should be able to read.

For example, if you mounted your HR policies at `/data/hr-policies` and your engineering handbook at `/data/engineering`, you could select one or both.

## 6. Click Create

Pinchy creates the agent, configures its OpenClaw workspace with the appropriate tool restrictions, and installs the `pinchy-files` plugin with the selected directories.

## 7. Chat with the agent

Select your new agent from the sidebar and start chatting. The agent can:

- List files in the directories you selected
- Read the contents of those files
- Answer questions based on what it reads

The agent **cannot**:

- Access files outside the selected directories
- Execute shell commands
- Make network requests
- Read system files

## How it works

Under the hood, Pinchy applies a defense-in-depth approach. See [Agent Permissions](/concepts/agent-permissions/) for the full explanation of how scoped tools, path validation, and tool deny policies work together.
